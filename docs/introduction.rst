Introduction
------------
In time-resolved fluorescence experiments the fluorescence intensity decay of a
sample is monitored. To date this is mostly accomplished by repeatedly exciting
the sample by a short laser pulse and recording the time between the sample excitation
and the detection of photons. In such pulsed experiments the micro time in a ``TTTR``
object encodes the time between the excitation pulse and the detection of the photon.
In analogue counting electronics is mostly operated in an inverse mode where the
time between the photon and the subsequent detection pulse is recorded. After multiple
photons have been recorded fluorescence decay histograms are computed. The shape
of these histograms corresponds to the underlying fluorescence decay, f(t).
